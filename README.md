# Cybersecurity Hands-On Labs

This repository contains enterprise-aligned cybersecurity labs mapped to real-world job roles including vulnerability management, cloud security, IAM, SOC automation, and GRC.

PROJECT 1 — Cloud Security Posture & CNAPP Engineering
(Cloud-Native Security Foundations Project).


Objective: I Demonstrated how modern cloud environments are secured end-to-end, from insecure IaC to runtime detection and governance mapping — exactly how CNAPP platforms operate in real enterprises.


This project proves I'm not just monitoring cloud security, but engineering it.
Core Domains Covered:
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP)
Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) Security
Kubernetes Security (Baseline + Runtime)
CNAPP Risk Correlation
Cloud GRC (NIST / CIS / CSA CCM)


Labs (Already Completed in Project 1)
Lab 1 – Vulnerability Discovery
Misconfigured cloud resources
Security findings surfaced via policy
Lab 2 – Risk Prioritization
Context-aware risk scoring
Business impact framing
Lab 3 – Detection Engineering
Cloud detection logic
Signal → alert pipeline
Lab 4 – DNS C2 Detection
Command-and-control behavior modeling
Lab 5 – Threat Hunting (Purple Team)
Hypothesis-driven hunting
Lab 6 – Executive Incident Leadership
Executive reporting
Decision-making under incident pressure


Employer-Grade Artifacts
Cloud security assessment report
Detection engineering write-ups
Incident executive brief
Threat model & response narrative
Governance-aligned security posture summary


My Interview Narrative (How I Explain It):
I approached cloud security the way CNAPP platforms do — starting with posture, then workloads, then detection, and finally executive decision-making. Instead of treating alerts in isolation, I focused on how misconfigurations become real attack paths and how leadership consumes that risk.


Roles This Project Supports
Cloud Security Engineer
CNAPP Engineer (Wiz / Prisma / Defender)
Azure / AWS Security Engineer
Security Consultant
Cloud GRC Engineer


PROJECT 2 — Cloud-Native Security Engineering (Identity, Kubernetes, CNAPP, GRC).
(Staff-Level Cloud Security Capstone)
This is not IAM-only — this is identity-driven cloud security engineering.


Objective: I Prove that I can secure modern cloud platforms holistically, where identity is the control plane, Kubernetes is the workload layer, and CNAPP + GRC translate technical risk into business decisions.


This project positions me squarely at Staff / Principal Cloud Security Engineer level.
Core Domains Covered:
Cloud IAM & Identity Engineering
Kubernetes Security (Baseline + Runtime)
Runtime Threat Detection (Falco / Defender)
CNAPP-style Risk Correlation
Azure Defender for Cloud
Cloud GRC Mapping (NIST / CIS / CSA CCM)


Labs (Completed)
Lab 1 – IaC Security (Terraform)
Misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure
Provider risk & policy enforcement
Lab 2 – Identity & Access Management
Cloud IAM controls
Identity as the new perimeter
Lab 3 – Kubernetes Baseline Security
Insecure pod specifications
Hardening via policy
Lab 4 – Kubernetes Runtime Threat Detection
Runtime anomaly detection
Event correlation
Lab 5 – CNAPP Risk Correlation
Wiz-style attack paths
Azure Defender narrative
Lab 6 – Cloud GRC Mapping
NIST / CIS / CSA CCM mapping
Executive governance artifacts


Employer-Grade Artifacts
Kubernetes security assessments
Runtime detection logic
CNAPP-style attack path models
Defender for Cloud narratives
GRC control mapping matrix
Executive risk summaries


Interview Narrative (Staff-Level Answer):
I treated cloud security as a system. Identity defines access, Kubernetes defines execution, runtime telemetry defines behavior, CNAPP defines risk correlation, and GRC defines how leadership acts. Each lab builds on the previous one to show how attackers move — and how defenders stop them.


Roles This Project Supports:
Cloud Security Engineer (Azure-focused)
CNAPP Engineer
Kubernetes Security Engineer
Cloud Security Architect
Staff / Principal Cloud Security Engineer


PROJECT 3 — Vulnerability Management & Risk-Based Prioritization
(ISSO / RMF / Fed-style credibility).


Objective: Proves I can move from raw vulnerabilities → risk decisions → POA&M instead of just running scanners.


Core Domains:
Vulnerability Management
Risk-Based Prioritization
RMF / ISSO thinking


Labs (Planned)
Asset-aware vulnerability dataset
CVE ≠ risk demonstration
Compensating controls when patching isn’t possible
POA&M lifecycle


Artifacts:
Vulnerability register
Risk scoring logic
POA&M tracker
Executive risk memo


Roles This Unlocks:
Vuln Analyst → ISSO → RMF Engineer → Security Consultant


PROJECT 4 — Network Security Modernization
(Deep engineering credibility project)


Objective: Shows I can design, enforce, and troubleshoot Zero Trust traffic paths, not just diagram them.


Core Domains:
SASE / ZTNA
Firewall Engineering
WAF & DDoS
NAC (Cisco ISE)


Labs (Planned):
Legacy perimeter → Zero Trust migration
Firewall rule lifecycle & cleanup
NAC segmentation failure scenario
WAF protection vs app-layer attack


Artifacts:
Network security architecture
Firewall rule governance policy
Incident containment narrative
Audit-ready rule review


Roles This Unlocks
Network Engineer → Firewall Lead → Principal Security Engineer


PROJECT 5 — Enterprise Data Security & Compliance
(CISO-level thinking)


Objective: This Demonstrate that I protect data as the asset, not just infrastructure.


Core Domains:
Data Security Architecture
DLP / DSPM
Encryption & Governance
Regulatory overlays


Labs (Planned):
Data discovery & classification
Insider risk scenario
SaaS data exposure
Regulatory impact (GDPR / HIPAA)


Artifacts:
Data flow diagrams
DLP policy framework
Compliance mapping
Executive breach impact analysis


Roles This Unlocks:
Data Security Lead → GRC → Privacy / Compliance Architect


PROJECT 6 — SOC Automation, SOAR & Advanced Security Engineering
(Principal / Research-grade project)


Objective: This Shows how detection, automation, and response scale security teams.


Core Domains:
SIEM & Detection Engineering
SOAR (XSOAR)
Endpoint telemetry
Continuous Monitoring (RMF)


Labs (Planned):
Custom detection logic
Alert enrichment pipelines
Automated containment playbooks
Non-standard telemetry (IoT / simulated hardware)


Artifacts:
Detection logic repo
SOAR playbooks
MTTR reduction metrics
Research-style write-ups


Roles This Unlocks
SOC Architect → Principal Engineer → Security Research
