## 🔹 Executive Summary (Leadership / Non-Technical)

**Lab 1: Vulnerability Discovery with Asset Context Enrichment**

This assessment performed active vulnerability discovery against a scoped environment to identify exposed services and assess associated risk using both technical severity and business context.

Multiple vulnerabilities were identified across host and application services; however, **risk prioritization was driven by asset criticality, exposure, and data sensitivity rather than CVSS alone**. Internet-facing services supporting business-critical functions were prioritized for remediation, while internally scoped or lab-only findings were documented and deprioritized as accepted risk.

This approach mirrors real-world vulnerability management programs, where **reducing business risk—not vulnerability count—is the primary objective**.

**Outcome:**
The engagement successfully demonstrated end-to-end vulnerability discovery, contextual enrichment, and risk-based triage aligned with modern SOC and vulnerability management practices.

## 🔹 Analyst Findings (SOC / Vulnerability Analyst View)

### 1. Discovery & Enumeration

Active scanning was conducted using Nmap with service detection and vulnerability enumeration enabled.

**Key activities performed:**

* Service discovery using `-sV`
* Vulnerability enumeration using `--script vuln`
* Artifact capture using `-oN` for audit-ready evidence

**Notable services discovered:**

* OpenSSH (TCP/22)
* Splunkd Management & Web Interfaces (TCP/8000, 8089)
* HTTP services susceptible to Slowloris DoS (CVE-2007-6750)

Exploit references and CVE mappings were identified via Vulners integration, providing immediate threat context.

---

### 2. Asset Context Enrichment

Raw scan data was enriched with asset inventory metadata to support risk-based decision-making.

**Contextual attributes applied:**

* Business unit ownership
* Asset criticality
* Data sensitivity classification
* Network exposure (internet-facing vs internal)

This enrichment enabled differentiation between **technical severity** and **true organizational risk**, preventing over-escalation of low-impact findings.

---

### 3. Risk-Based Triage & Prioritization

Findings were triaged using a combination of:

* Vulnerability severity
* Asset criticality
* Exposure level
* Potential business impact

**High-risk findings prioritized:**

* Internet-facing services on high-criticality assets
* Services with known exploit references and availability impact

**Deprioritized / Accepted Risk:**

* Slowloris DoS identified on localhost-only services
  *Rationale:* Non-production, lab-scoped exposure with no external attack surface.

This reflects standard SOC and vulnerability governance workflows, where **context determines actionability**.

---

### 4. Analyst Judgment & Decision-Making

Rather than treating all vulnerabilities equally, analyst judgment was applied to:

* Identify findings requiring escalation
* Document accepted risk with justification
* Preserve evidence for audit and review

This demonstrates maturity beyond tool execution and aligns with how senior analysts operate in enterprise environments.

---

## 🔹 Final Assessment

**This lab demonstrates proficiency in:**

* Vulnerability discovery & enumeration
* Asset inventory correlation
* Risk-based vulnerability prioritization
* Evidence handling & documentation
* GitHub-based delivery and traceability

**This is not a scan-and-dump exercise.**
It reflects real SOC and consulting workflows used to inform remediation decisions and reduce organizational risk.
