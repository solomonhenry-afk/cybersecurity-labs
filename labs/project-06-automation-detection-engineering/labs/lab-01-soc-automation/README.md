# Lab 01 — SOC Automation & Alert Enrichment

## Objective
Demonstrate how SOC operations scale through automation by transforming raw security alerts into enriched, decision-ready incidents.

This lab simulates a modern SOC pipeline where:
- Alerts are ingested from detection sources
- Context is automatically enriched (asset, threat intel, business impact)
- Triage decisions are accelerated through automation

The focus is not alert volume — it is **MTTR reduction and analyst efficiency**.

## Why This Matters
Most SOCs fail not because they lack detections, but because analysts drown in low-context alerts.
This lab shows how automation shifts SOCs from reactive queues to risk-driven response.

## Scope
- Alert ingestion
- Automated enrichment
- SOC triage workflow
- Evidence capture for audit and leadership review

## Outcome
A repeatable, auditable SOC automation framework aligned to senior/principal engineering expectations.
