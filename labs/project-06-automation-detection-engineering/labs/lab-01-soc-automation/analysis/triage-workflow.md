# SOC Triage Workflow

## Traditional Workflow (Broken)
Alert → Manual lookup → Manual decision → Delayed response

## Automated Workflow
Alert → Enrichment → Risk-based routing → Analyst action

## Analyst Experience
- Fewer alerts
- More context
- Clear decision paths

## Metrics Improved
- Mean Time To Triage (MTTT)
- Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
- Analyst fatigue and error rates

This workflow mirrors mature SOC operations at scale.
