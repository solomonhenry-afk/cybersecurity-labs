# Lab 04 — MTTR Reduction, SOC Metrics & Executive Reporting

## Objective
This lab demonstrates how SOC automation, detection engineering, and SOAR execution translate into measurable business outcomes — specifically Mean Time To Respond (MTTR) reduction and incident cost avoidance.

Rather than treating SOC metrics as operational noise, this lab reframes them as executive decision tools that answer:
- Are we responding fast enough?
- Where are we losing time?
- What financial risk remains?

## Why This Matters
Security leaders are not evaluated on alert volume — they are evaluated on:
- Speed of containment
- Business disruption
- Cost of incidents
- Confidence in reporting

This lab closes the loop between engineering effort and executive confidence.

## What This Lab Proves
- MTTR improvements are measurable and defensible
- Automation removes human bottlenecks
- SOC metrics can be aligned to business risk
- Security reporting can support budget, staffing, and tooling decisions
