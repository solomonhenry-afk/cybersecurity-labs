# Baseline MTTR Analysis

## Scope
This analysis establishes the SOC response baseline prior to automation and advanced detection engineering.

## Key Observations
- Alert triage relied heavily on manual investigation
- Context gathering averaged 30–45 minutes per incident
- Escalation decisions were inconsistent across analysts
- False positives delayed real incident response

## Baseline Metrics
- Average MTTR: 4.8 hours
- Analyst touchpoints per incident: 6–8
- Mean escalation delay: 55 minutes

## Risk Implication
Extended MTTR increases:
- Lateral movement opportunity
- Data exposure likelihood
- Recovery and legal costs
