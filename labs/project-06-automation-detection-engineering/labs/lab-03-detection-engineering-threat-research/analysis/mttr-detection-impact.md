# MTTR Impact Assessment

High-fidelity detections directly reduce Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

### Baseline
- Generic alerts
- High noise
- Average response: ~60 minutes

### Post-Detection Engineering
- Behavior-based alerts
- SOAR-triggered enrichment
- Average response: ~10–15 minutes

This lab proves detection engineering is a **force multiplier** when paired with automation and orchestration.
