# Coverage Gaps Assessment

No detection strategy is complete.

### Identified Gaps
- Encrypted east-west traffic visibility
- Limited endpoint telemetry on legacy systems
- Insider misuse within approved access boundaries

### Risk Treatment
- Document gaps explicitly
- Compensate using controls from other labs (DLP, encryption, access governance)
- Avoid false confidence

This assessment demonstrates **mature detection ownership**, not perfection.
