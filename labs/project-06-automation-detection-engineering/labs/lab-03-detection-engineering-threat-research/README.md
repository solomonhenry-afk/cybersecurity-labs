# Lab 03 — Detection Engineering & Threat Research

This lab focuses on **engineering high-fidelity detections** driven by threat intelligence and attacker behavior,
 rather than reactive alert tuning.

The objective is to demonstrate how modern security teams:
- Start with **threat hypotheses**
- Translate them into **behavior-based detection logic**
- Measure detection value using **false positive rates, coverage gaps, and MTTR impact**

This lab connects directly to:
- Lab 01 (SOC Automation): what happens *after* detection
- Lab 02 (SOAR/XSOAR): how response is orchestrated
- Lab 03 (this lab): what deserves detection at all

Detection engineering is treated as a **risk-reduction discipline**, not a SIEM configuration task.
