# Lab 02 — SOAR / XSOAR Playbooks & Automated Response

## Objective
This lab demonstrates how security detections are transformed into
structured, automated response using SOAR/XSOAR-style playbooks.

The focus is not blind automation, but **risk-aware orchestration**
that balances speed, control, and executive accountability.

## What This Lab Proves
- Ability to design production-grade SOAR playbooks
- Clear separation of automated vs human-gated actions
- Reduction of MTTR without increasing operational risk
- Alignment with real SOC tooling (XSOAR, Splunk SOAR, Sentinel)

## Threats Covered
- Phishing campaigns
- Malware execution
- Privileged account abuse

## Business Outcome
Consistent response, reduced analyst fatigue, and defensible incident handling
that leadership can trust.
