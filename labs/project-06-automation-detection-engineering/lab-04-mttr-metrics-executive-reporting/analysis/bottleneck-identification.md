# SOC Bottleneck Identification

## Primary Bottlenecks Identified
1. Manual data enrichment
2. Unclear escalation thresholds
3. Tool switching overhead
4. Analyst uncertainty during ambiguous alerts

## Resolution Strategy
- Centralized enrichment logic
- Playbook-driven decisions
- Automated containment where confidence is high
- Human-in-the-loop only where necessary

## Result
Bottlenecks shifted from operational friction to deliberate decision points.
