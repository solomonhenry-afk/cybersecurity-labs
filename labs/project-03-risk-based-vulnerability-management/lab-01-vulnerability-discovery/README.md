# Lab 01 — CVE ≠ Risk
## Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization (ISSO / RMF Perspective)

### Objective
Demonstrate that vulnerability severity does not equal organizational risk.
This lab evaluates the same CVE across different assets to support executive-level risk decisions.

---

### Scenario
A vulnerability scan identifies a CVSS 9.8 Remote Code Execution vulnerability affecting two systems.
Leadership requests immediate remediation across the environment.
The ISSO must determine actual business risk.

---

### Asset A — Customer Portal

| Factor | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| CVSS | 9.8 |
| Exposure | Internet-facing |
| Data Sensitivity | High (PII) |
| Threat Activity | Actively exploited |
| Business Impact | Revenue, reputation |
| Compensating Controls | Limited |
| **Final Risk Rating** | **CRITICAL** |

**Decision:**  
Immediate remediation required  
SLA: 72 hours  
Executive escalation required

---

### Asset B — Research Lab VM

| Factor | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| CVSS | 9.8 |
| Exposure | Isolated network |
| Data Sensitivity | Low |
| Threat Activity | Unlikely to reach asset |
| Business Impact | Minimal |
| Compensating Controls | Network isolation |
| **Final Risk Rating** | **LOW** |

**Decision:**  
Patch during next maintenance window  
No executive escalation

### Key Learning
CVSS measures vulnerability severity, not organizational risk.
Risk emerges when vulnerability intersects with asset value, exposure, and threat capability.
