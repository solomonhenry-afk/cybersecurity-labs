# Control-to-Risk Mapping

## Risk Statement
Exploitation of an unpatched RCE vulnerability on an internet-facing application could result in data compromise and service disruption.

## Mapping Compensating Controls to Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Compensating Control | Impact |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| External Exposure | Firewall segmentation | Reduces attack surface |
| Known Exploits | WAF rules | Blocks commodity exploitation |
| Detection Gaps | Centralized logging | Improves response time |
| Privilege Abuse | MFA and access review | Limits blast radius |

---

## Control Alignment
- Preventive controls reduce likelihood
- Detective controls reduce dwell time
- Administrative controls enforce governance

---

## Risk Posture Shift
Original Risk: **CRITICAL**  
Post-Control Risk: **MODERATE**

Risk is reduced to an acceptable level pending permanent remediation.
