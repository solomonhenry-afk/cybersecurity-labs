# Compensating Controls Analysis

## Scenario
A critical internet-facing application contains a high-severity RCE vulnerability.
Immediate patching is not possible due to business uptime requirements.

---

## Identified Compensating Controls

### 1. Network Segmentation
- Restrict access to the vulnerable service via firewall rules
- Limit inbound traffic to approved IP ranges

### 2. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Deploy signatures to block exploit patterns associated with the CVE
- Enable anomaly detection and rate limiting

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Increase log verbosity for affected services
- Implement real-time alerting for exploit indicators

### 4. Access Hardening
- Enforce MFA for administrative access
- Remove unnecessary service accounts

## Control Effectiveness Assessment

| Control | Risk Reduction | Coverage |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Network Segmentation | High | External threat vectors |
| WAF | Medium–High | Known exploit techniques |
| Monitoring | Medium | Detection, not prevention |
| Access Hardening | Medium | Insider and lateral movement |

---

## Conclusion
While these controls do not eliminate the vulnerability, they significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of exploitation, allowing for **controlled risk acceptance**.
