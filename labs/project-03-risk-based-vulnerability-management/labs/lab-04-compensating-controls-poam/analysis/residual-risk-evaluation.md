## Definition
Residual risk represents the level of risk remaining after compensating controls are applied.

## Residual Risk Assessment

| Category | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Likelihood | Reduced due to perimeter controls |
| Impact | Still high due to asset criticality |
| Detectability | Improved with enhanced monitoring |

---

## Residual Risk Rating
**MODERATE**

---

## Acceptance Criteria
Residual risk is considered acceptable because:
- Exploitation likelihood is significantly reduced
- Detection and response capabilities are in place
- A remediation timeline is formally tracked via POA&M

---

## Review Requirements
- Reassess risk every 30 days
- Re-evaluate controls upon threat landscape changes
- Escalate if exploit activity increases

Residual risk acceptance is **temporary and conditional**.
