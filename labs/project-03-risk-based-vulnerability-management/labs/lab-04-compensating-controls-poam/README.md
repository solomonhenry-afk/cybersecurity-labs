# Lab 04 — Compensating Controls & POA&M Lifecycle

## Objective
Demonstrate how organizations manage risk when immediate remediation (patching) is not feasible by implementing compensating controls, evaluating residual risk, and formally tracking ownership through a POA&M.

This lab focuses on **decision-making under constraint**, not technical perfection.

---

## Why This Lab Matters
In real enterprise environments:
- Patching may be delayed due to uptime requirements
- Legacy systems may be unpatchable
- Business leadership may accept risk temporarily

Security maturity is defined by **how well risk is controlled, documented, and governed** — not whether vulnerabilities exist.

---

## Lab Scope
This lab builds on Project 3 Labs 01–03 and includes:
- Compensating control analysis
- Control-to-risk mapping
- Residual risk evaluation
- Formal POA&M lifecycle management

---

## Outcome
By completing this lab, you demonstrate the ability to:
- Reduce risk without patching
- Quantify residual exposure
- Assign accountability
- Operate in an audit-ready posture

This is ISSO-grade work.
