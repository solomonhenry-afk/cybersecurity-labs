# Risk Acceptance Narrative

## Risk Overview
A critical vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) was identified across multiple assets.
Risk-based prioritization determined differing impact levels based on exposure,
data sensitivity, and business function.

---

## Decision Context
Immediate remediation was prioritized for internet-facing, mission-critical systems.
For lower-impact, isolated systems, compensating controls reduce exploitability.

---

## Risk Acceptance Statement
The organization formally accepts residual risk for the affected non-internet-facing systems
until the next scheduled maintenance window.

This decision is based on:
- Low likelihood of exploitation due to network isolation
- Minimal business and data impact
- Existing compensating controls
- Resource prioritization toward higher-risk assets

---

## Acceptance Conditions
- Risk acceptance is **time-bound**
- Expiration aligned with next patch cycle
- Continuous monitoring remains in place
- Reassessment required if threat conditions change

---

## Accountability
Risk ownership is assigned to the system owner in coordination with security leadership.
Acceptance has been reviewed and approved by executive stakeholders.

---

## Key Principle
Risk is not eliminated — it is **consciously owned**.
