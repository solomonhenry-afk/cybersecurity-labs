# Lab 03 — Executive Risk Communication

## Purpose
This lab demonstrates the ability to translate technical vulnerability and risk analysis into
clear, decision-ready communication for executives, risk owners, and governance bodies.

The focus is not technical depth, but **clarity, accountability, and decision framing**.

---

## Scenario Summary
Following vulnerability discovery and risk-based prioritization (Labs 01–02), leadership requires
an executive-level assessment to determine:

- Whether the risk should be remediated immediately
- Whether risk can be temporarily accepted
- Who formally owns the decision

This lab simulates that communication.

---

## Key Outcomes
- Executive risk memo written in non-technical language
- Explicit risk acceptance narrative
- Clear articulation of business impact and trade-offs
- Alignment with ISSO / GRC operating expectations

---

## Artifacts
- Executive Risk Memo
- Risk Acceptance Narrative
- Supporting evidence screenshots

---

## Why This Matters
Executives do not make decisions based on CVEs or CVSS scores.
They decide based on **business impact, likelihood, and accountability**.

This lab proves the ability to operate at that level.
