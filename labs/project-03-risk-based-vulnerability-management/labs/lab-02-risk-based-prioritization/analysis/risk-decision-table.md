## Why This Matters
Identical vulnerabilities can produce different outcomes when evaluated
through an asset-aware risk lens.

This enables responsible risk acceptance instead of reactive patching.

## Why This Decision Process Matters

Without contextual risk evaluation, organizations often:
- Over-prioritize low-impact vulnerabilities
- Miss high-risk attack paths
- Waste remediation capacity
- Increase operational friction

This decision table demonstrates how identical vulnerabilities
can produce different remediation outcomes without increasing risk exposure.

This approach supports responsible risk acceptance rather than reactive patching.
