# Lab 02 — Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization (CVE ≠ Risk)

## Objective
Demonstrate how vulnerability severity alone is insufficient for remediation decisions, and how
risk emerges only when vulnerabilities are evaluated in business and threat context.

This lab formalizes a repeatable, defensible prioritization process aligned with
enterprise vulnerability management and RMF practices.

---

## Scenario
A vulnerability scan identifies the same critical CVE (CVSS 9.8) affecting multiple systems.
Leadership demands immediate remediation across the environment.

Security must determine:
- Which systems pose real organizational risk
- Where remediation must be immediate
- Where risk can be accepted or deferred

---

## Methodology
1. Apply an asset-aware risk scoring model
2. Evaluate exposure, threat activity, and business impact
3. Produce a risk-informed remediation decision
4. Generate executive-ready outputs

---

## Key Outcome
CVSS measures vulnerability severity — not organizational risk.

Risk-based prioritization enables focused remediation, reduced operational noise,
and defensible risk acceptance.

---

## What This Lab Demonstrates
This lab proves the ability to:
- Translate technical findings into business risk
- Apply consistent decision logic across assets
- Justify remediation urgency using context
- Support executive and ISSO-level decision-making

## What This Lab Demonstrates

This lab demonstrates the ability to move from vulnerability data to
risk-based remediation decisions aligned with business impact.

Specifically, it proves the capability to:
- Distinguish vulnerability severity from organizational risk
- Apply consistent decision logic across heterogeneous assets
- Justify remediation urgency using business and threat context
- Defend risk acceptance decisions when immediate patching is not required

This mirrors how mature enterprises and federal programs prioritize
remediation without overwhelming operational teams.
