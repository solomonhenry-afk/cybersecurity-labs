# Executive Summary — Cloud Exposure Risk

An intentionally insecure Azure environment was deployed to model real-world
cloud misconfiguration risk.

## Key Business Risks
- Potential unauthorized data access through public storage
- Increased attack surface via exposed Kubernetes control plane
- Identity and access gaps that enable privilege escalation
- Governance gaps impacting audit readiness and compliance

## Business Impact
If left unaddressed, these conditions increase the likelihood of:
- Data breaches
- Service disruption
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Loss of customer trust

This lab establishes the baseline attack surface for subsequent
identity, policy, and CNAPP remediation labs.
