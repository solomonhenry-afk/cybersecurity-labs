# Executive Cloud Risk Summary

## Key Insight
Cloud security failures are governance failures before they are technical failures.

---

## What Was Identified
Across Project 2 labs, multiple risks were identified:
- Over-privileged identities
- Insecure infrastructure definitions
- Kubernetes workload misconfigurations
- Limited runtime visibility

---

## Why This Matters
Unchecked cloud risks can result in:
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Data exposure
- Business disruption
- Loss of executive trust

---

## How This Is Addressed
By mapping technical findings to:
- NIST SP 800-53
- CIS Controls v8
- CSA Cloud Controls Matrix

Security risks become:
- Measurable
- Auditable
- Actionable

---

## Executive Outcome
Leadership gains:
- Clear accountability
- Risk prioritization
- Defensible compliance posture


## Business Context
Cloud misconfigurations introduce systemic risk across infrastructure,
identity, and workloads.

## What Was Found
- Insecure IaC patterns
- Identity over-privileging
- Kubernetes exposure
- Runtime threat indicators

## Why It Matters
These findings map directly to regulatory and contractual obligations.

## Executive Recommendation
Adopt CNAPP-driven risk correlation and policy enforcement to reduce exposure.
