# DLP Risk Analysis

Not all data loss carries equal impact. This analysis prioritizes data protection
based on business, legal, and reputational risk.

## High-Risk Data Categories
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Financial records and payment data
- Customer contracts and pricing models

## Impact Dimensions
- Regulatory penalties (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Loss of customer trust
- Financial loss and litigation
- Competitive disadvantage

## Risk Conclusion
DLP controls must be strongest where data loss creates irreversible damage.
Low-risk data should not receive the same enforcement posture as regulated or
mission-critical datasets.
