# Lab 02 — DLP Strategy & Enforcement

## Objective
This lab demonstrates how Data Loss Prevention (DLP) should be designed and enforced as a
risk-based business control rather than a blanket technical restriction.

The focus is on:
- Protecting high-impact data first
- Reducing regulatory exposure
- Preventing insider and cloud-based exfiltration
- Balancing enforcement with business productivity

## Scope
- Sensitive data identified in Lab 01 (PII, PHI, Financial, Intellectual Property)
- Common exfiltration vectors: email, cloud storage, endpoints, third parties
- Enforcement decisions mapped to business risk

## Key Outcomes
- A defensible DLP strategy aligned to real-world threat scenarios
- Executive-ready enforcement decision logic
- Policies and exception handling suitable for audit and compliance reviews
