# Project 5 – Lab 01: Data Discovery & Classification

## Objective
Establish enterprise-wide visibility into where sensitive data exists, how it is classified, and how it moves across systems.

This lab demonstrates that effective data security, DLP, and compliance programs begin with accurate data discovery and ownership — not tooling.

## Scope
- Endpoints
- SaaS platforms
- Cloud storage
- Internal databases

## Key Outcomes
- Identified sensitive and shadow data locations
- Applied a business-aligned data classification framework
- Mapped data flows across trust boundaries

## Why This Matters
Organizations cannot protect, govern, or comply with regulations for data they do not know exists. This lab provides the foundational visibility required for DLP, DSPM, encryption strategy, and regulatory decision-making.
