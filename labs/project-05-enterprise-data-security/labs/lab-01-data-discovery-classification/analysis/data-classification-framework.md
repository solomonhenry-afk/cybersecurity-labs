# Data Classification Framework

## Classification Levels
- Public: Approved for unrestricted disclosure
- Internal: Business-use only
- Confidential: Sensitive business or customer data
- Restricted: Regulated or high-impact data (PII, PHI, financial)

## Regulatory Mapping
- GDPR: Personal data, special categories
- HIPAA: Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Contractual: Customer and partner agreements

## Control Expectations
Each classification level mandates specific controls, including access restrictions, encryption, monitoring, and retention requirements.

## Business Alignment
Classification is based on business impact and regulatory exposure, not just data type.
