# Data Discovery Findings

## Overview
A discovery exercise was conducted across enterprise systems to identify datasets containing sensitive information.

## Key Findings
- Sensitive data discovered in both managed and unmanaged locations
- Multiple datasets lacked clear ownership
- Some sensitive data was exposed beyond intended access boundaries

## High-Risk Observations
- PII stored in general-purpose SaaS tools
- Internal databases accessible by non-business-critical roles
- Inconsistent labeling of sensitive datasets

## Risk Implication
Lack of visibility and ownership significantly increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, data leakage, and regulatory non-compliance.
