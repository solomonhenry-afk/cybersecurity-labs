# Data Flow Analysis

## Objective
Understand how sensitive data moves across systems and trust boundaries.

## Observed Data Flows
- User → Web Application → SaaS Platform
- Application → Cloud Storage → Analytics Platform

## Risk Points
- Data crossing trust boundaries without consistent encryption
- Limited visibility into downstream data consumers
- Inconsistent logging at data egress points

## Impact
Unmonitored data flows increase breach impact and complicate incident response and regulatory notification.
