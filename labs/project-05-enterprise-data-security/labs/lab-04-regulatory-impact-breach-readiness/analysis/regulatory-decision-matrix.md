# Regulatory Decision Matrix

This matrix defines when breach notification is required versus
when internal handling is sufficient.

Decision Factors:
- Type of data involved
- Encryption state
- Evidence of access or exfiltration
- Risk to data subjects

Mandatory Notification Triggers:
- Unencrypted PII or PHI exposed
- Confirmed unauthorized access
- High likelihood of identity harm

Optional / Not Required:
- Encrypted data with key integrity preserved
- No evidence of access or misuse
- Internal containment without exposure

Governance:
- Legal counsel validates notification decisions
- CISO provides technical risk assessment
- Executive leadership approves disclosure actions

This matrix prevents over-reporting while ensuring regulatory compliance.
