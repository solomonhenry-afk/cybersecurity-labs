# Breach Impact Assessment

This assessment evaluates breach impact across four dimensions:
financial, regulatory, operational, and reputational.

Impact is driven by:
- Data sensitivity (PII, PHI, financial data)
- Encryption status at time of exposure
- Scope of affected individuals
- Likelihood of misuse or exploitation

Financial Impact:
- Regulatory fines (GDPR up to 4% global revenue)
- Litigation and class action exposure
- Incident response and remediation costs

Regulatory Impact:
- Mandatory notification requirements
- Regulator scrutiny and audits
- Long-term compliance oversight

Reputational Impact:
- Loss of customer trust
- Brand damage
- Market confidence erosion

Conclusion:
Encryption, data minimization, and documented response readiness
significantly reduce breach impact even when incidents occur.
