# Notification Timeline Analysis

This analysis operationalizes regulatory notification timelines.

GDPR:
- 72 hours from breach discovery
- Applies to personal data of EU residents
- Requires documented rationale for delays

HIPAA:
- Without unreasonable delay
- No later than 60 days
- Affected individuals and HHS notified

Internal SLAs:
- Incident validation within 24 hours
- Executive briefing within 48 hours
- Legal determination before regulatory submission

Missed timelines increase fines, enforcement actions,
and regulatory distrust.

Preparedness ensures timelines are met without panic-driven decisions.
