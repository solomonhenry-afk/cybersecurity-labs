# Lab 04 — Regulatory Impact & Breach Readiness

This lab demonstrates how security incidents transition into legal, regulatory,
and executive-level events. The focus is not detection, but decision-making under
regulatory pressure.

The objective is to assess breach impact, determine notification obligations,
and execute coordinated response actions aligned with GDPR, HIPAA, and enterprise
governance expectations.

This lab simulates real-world breach scenarios where:
- Not every incident requires disclosure
- Timing, encryption status, and data type determine regulatory impact
- Executive judgment and legal coordination are critical

Key Outcomes:
- Breach impact is quantified beyond technical severity
- Notification decisions are defensible and documented
- Regulatory timelines are operationalized, not theoretical
- Executive readiness is built before incidents occur
