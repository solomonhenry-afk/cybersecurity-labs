# Project 5 — Lab 03: Encryption & Key Management

## Objective
Demonstrate how encryption and key management reduce real breach impact, not just satisfy compliance checklists.

This lab focuses on:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Centralized key management (KMS/HSM)
- Key lifecycle governance
- Breach impact reduction analysis

## Why This Lab Matters
Data breaches are inevitable. The determining factor is whether stolen data is usable.

Encryption without strong key management does not meaningfully reduce risk.
Keys are the control plane.

## Scope
- Databases, cloud storage, SaaS platforms
- Encryption coverage analysis
- Key lifecycle (generation → rotation → revocation)
- Insider and cloud exfiltration scenarios

## Executive Takeaway
> If attackers cannot access the keys, the breach impact is dramatically reduced — operationally, legally, and reputationally.
