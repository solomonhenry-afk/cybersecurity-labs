# Project 4 — Lab 04: WAF, DDoS & Application Traffic Protection

## Objective
Demonstrate how modern organizations protect application-layer traffic using Web Application Firewalls (WAF), DDoS mitigation, and adaptive controls — aligned to Zero Trust principles and business risk.

This lab focuses on **preventing availability loss, data exposure, and abuse of internet-facing applications**, not just blocking generic attacks.

## Scope
- Application-layer threat modeling
- WAF control effectiveness analysis
- DDoS attack response and resilience
- Governance and policy alignment

## Why This Matters
Most breaches and outages today occur **above Layer 4**:
- API abuse
- Application-layer DDoS
- Credential stuffing
- Injection and logic abuse

Network firewalls alone are insufficient.

## Outcomes
- Translate application threats into enforceable controls
- Evaluate WAF rules as risk controls, not signatures
- Show executive-ready justification for WAF and DDoS investments

Proves:

- WAF ≠ checkbox security

- Application-layer attacks bypass perimeter controls

- DDoS is availability risk, not just traffic volume

This lab focuses on protection efficacy + business impact
