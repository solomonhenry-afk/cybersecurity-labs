# Application Traffic Protection Standards

## Required Controls
- WAF enabled for all internet-facing apps
- Rate limiting on auth and API endpoints
- Bot mitigation for high-risk functions
- DDoS protection upstream of application

## Alignment
- Zero Trust: Assume hostile traffic
- Defense in Depth: Multiple control layers
- Least Privilege: Limit request behavior

## Exceptions
- Must be documented
- Time-bound
- Risk accepted by leadership

Prove:

- WAF enforcement standards

- Change management expectations

- Escalation paths

- Audit defensibility
