# Access Decision Flow

## Step 1: Authentication
User identity is validated using strong authentication.

## Step 2: Device Posture Check
Device compliance and security state are evaluated.

## Step 3: Policy Evaluation
Access request is compared against NAC and Zero Trust policies.

## Step 4: Enforcement
Access is allowed, restricted, quarantined, or denied.

## Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
Behavioral changes or risk escalation trigger re-evaluation.

## Audit Value
Each decision is traceable, repeatable, and defensible.
