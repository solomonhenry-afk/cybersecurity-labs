# Identity & Device Trust Evaluation

Identity alone is insufficient in modern environments.

## Identity Attributes
- User role and privilege level
- Authentication strength (MFA, certificate-based)
- Session context

## Device Attributes
- Managed vs unmanaged
- Patch and compliance status
- Endpoint protection presence

## Access Outcomes
- Full access: trusted identity and compliant device
- Restricted access: trusted identity with limited posture
- Quarantine: unmanaged or non-compliant device
- Deny: high-risk identity or failed authentication

## Security Benefit
Prevents credential-only attacks and limits lateral movement.
