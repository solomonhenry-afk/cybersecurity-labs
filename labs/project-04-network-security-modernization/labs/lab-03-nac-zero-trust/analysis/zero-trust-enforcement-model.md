# Zero Trust Enforcement Model

Zero Trust is not a product but an operating model that requires continuous verification and enforcement.

## Trust Signals
Access decisions are based on:
- Identity: authenticated user and role
- Device posture: managed state, compliance, security agents
- Network context: location, segment, access method
- Risk indicators: anomalies, threat intelligence

## Enforcement Points
- Pre-access: authentication and posture checks
- During access: segmentation and policy enforcement
- Continuous: re-evaluation based on behavior changes

## Framework Alignment
- NIST SP 800-207: Policy Decision Point (PDP) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
- CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model: Identity, Device, Network pillars

## Outcome
Access is granted only when trust signals meet policy thresholds and is revoked when conditions change.
