# Lab 03 — NAC & Zero Trust Enforcement

## Objective
Demonstrate how Network Access Control (NAC) enforces Zero Trust principles by making access decisions based on identity, device posture, and risk — not network location.

## Problem Statement
Traditional perimeter-based access assumes trust once a device is connected. Modern threats exploit this assumption through compromised credentials, unmanaged devices, and lateral movement.

Zero Trust requires continuous verification and enforcement at the access layer.

## Role of NAC in Zero Trust
NAC acts as a policy enforcement point by:
- Validating user identity
- Evaluating device posture
- Applying conditional access controls
- Enforcing least-privilege segmentation

## What This Lab Demonstrates
- Identity- and device-aware access decisions
- Policy-based enforcement aligned to Zero Trust
- Auditable access logic suitable for enterprise and regulated environments

## Business & Security Impact
- Reduced attack surface
- Containment of compromised devices
- Defensible access decisions during audits and incidents
