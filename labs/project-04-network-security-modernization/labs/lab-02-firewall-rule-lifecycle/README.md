# Lab 02 — Firewall Rule Lifecycle & Governance

## Objective
Demonstrate how firewall rules themselves introduce risk when governance is absent, even if the firewall platform is correctly deployed.

This lab focuses on:
- Rule lifecycle management
- Risk introduced by permissive or stale rules
- Governance mechanisms that prevent rule sprawl over time

## Problem Statement
Most firewall-related breaches do not occur because a firewall is missing, but because:
- Rules persist beyond their original business purpose
- Ownership is unclear
- Risk is never re-evaluated after deployment

This lab evaluates firewall rules as **risk objects**, not static configurations.

## Scope
- Rule review and classification
- Risk analysis and blast radius assessment
- Stale rule identification
- Governance policy and operational checklist

## Outcome
A defensible, repeatable firewall governance model aligned with Zero Trust and audit expectations.
