#  Lab 6 — Executive Incident Leadership & Board-Level Response

## Executive Summary

This lab simulates a **real-world, high-severity cyber incident** and evaluates leadership-level decision-making under pressure.
The focus is **not technical detection**, but **executive judgment, communication, and risk governance**.

This mirrors responsibilities held by:

* Principal Security Engineers
* Incident Commanders
* Directors of Security Operations
* CISOs and Deputy CISOs

---

##  Lab Objective

Demonstrate the ability to:

* Lead an incident response at the **executive and board level**
* Balance **technical risk, business impact, legal exposure, and reputation**
* Communicate clearly with **non-technical stakeholders**
* Make time-sensitive decisions with incomplete information

---

##  Scenario Overview

A confirmed intrusion escalates from:

* Initial access
* Lateral movement
* Potential data exposure

Security leadership must:

* Coordinate SOC, IR, Legal, and Executive teams
* Decide on containment vs. business continuity
* Prepare for regulatory and board scrutiny

---

##  Artifacts & Deliverables

###  Incident Timeline

**Path:** `analysis/incident_timeline.md`

* Minute-by-minute breakdown of events
* Executive decision points highlighted
* Clear separation between facts, assumptions, and unknowns

---

###  Root Cause Analysis

**Path:** `analysis/root_cause_analysis.md`

* Technical root cause
* Control gaps identified
* Contributing organizational factors
* Preventive recommendations

---

###  Executive Decision Log

**Path:** `analysis/decision_log.md`

Documents:

* What decisions were made
* Why they were made
* Risks accepted
* Alternatives considered

This is how **real post-incident reviews** are conducted.

---

###  Executive / Board Brief

**Path:** `evidence/executive_brief.md`

Written for:

* Board members
* Executives
* Regulators

Includes:

* Plain-language risk explanation
* Business impact assessment
* Regulatory considerations
* Next-step recommendations

---

##  Business Impact Focus

This lab emphasizes:

* Revenue protection
* Legal and compliance exposure
* Brand and customer trust
* Operational continuity

Not every correct decision is purely technical — **this lab proves that understanding.**

---

##  Skills Demonstrated

* Executive incident leadership
* Crisis communication
* Risk-based decision making
* Governance & accountability
* Post-incident learning culture
* Board-level security reporting

---

##  Why This Matters

Most candidates stop at detection.

This lab proves the ability to:

* **Own incidents end-to-end**
* Speak the language of executives
* Lead during moments that define careers and companies

This is **principal-level signal**, not junior SOC work.

---

##  Lab Status

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Validation:** Realistic, structured, executive-aligned
**Portfolio Level:** Senior / Principal / CISO-track

---

## 🏁 My FINAL STATUS — PROJECT 1

With Lab 6 complete, you have demonstrated:

✅ Discovery & asset context (Lab 1)
✅ Risk-based prioritization (Lab 2)
✅ Detection engineering (Lab 3)
✅ C2 & DNS threat analysis (Lab 4)
✅ Threat hunting & purple team outcomes (Lab 5)
✅ **Executive incident leadership (Lab 6)**

This is no longer “portfolio work”.

This is **proof of senior capability**.
I’ve built something **very few candidates in the world can show**.
