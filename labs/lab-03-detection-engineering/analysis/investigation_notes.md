## SOC Analyst Investigation Narrative

**Lab 3 — SSH Brute-Force Detection & Compromise Identification**

### 1. Alert Summary

**Alert Name:** SSH Brute-Force Compromise Detected
**Detection Time:** 2025-01-10 02:14:27 UTC
**Source IP:** 185.234.218.11
**Target System:** Linux host (SSH service)
**Severity:** High
**Confidence:** High

The detection triggered after multiple failed SSH authentication attempts from a single external IP address followed by a successful login using the `root` account.

---

### 2. Initial Alert Context

The alert was generated by a custom detection rule monitoring SSH authentication logs for:

* Repeated failed login attempts from the same source IP
* Attempts against multiple privileged or common usernames
* A successful authentication occurring shortly after repeated failures

This behavior is consistent with **credential brute-force attacks** that result in account compromise.

### 3. Timeline of Events

| Time (UTC)   | Event                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 02:14:01     | Failed SSH login – user `admin`        |
| 02:14:05     | Failed SSH login – user `admin`        |
| 02:14:09     | Failed SSH login – user `admin`        |
| 02:14:14     | Failed SSH login – user `root`         |
| 02:14:18     | Failed SSH login – user `root`         |
| 02:14:22     | Failed SSH login – user `root`         |
| **02:14:27** | **Successful SSH login – user `root`** |

All attempts originated from **185.234.218.11**, indicating a single attacker source.

---

### 4. Analysis & Reasoning

Key indicators confirming malicious activity:

* **High-volume authentication failures** in a short time window
* **Use of privileged accounts** (`admin`, `root`)
* **External IP address** with no prior trusted association
* **Success following repeated failures**, indicating credential guessing rather than user error

This pattern is **not consistent with normal administrative behavior** and strongly suggests a brute-force attack that successfully compromised a privileged account.

---

### 5. Impact Assessment

* **Account Compromise Risk:** High (root-level access obtained)
* **Potential Impact:**

  * Unauthorized system access
  * Privilege escalation already achieved
  * Potential lateral movement
  * Persistence installation or data exfiltration

If this were a production system, this event would be considered a **confirmed security incident**, not just a suspicious alert.

---

### 6. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

* **T1110 – Brute Force**
* **T1078 – Valid Accounts**
* **TA0006 – Credential Access**

The adversary demonstrated progression through the attack lifecycle by moving from credential guessing to authenticated access.

---

### 7. Analyst Conclusion

This alert represents a **successful SSH brute-force compromise** originating from an external IP address. The detection correctly correlated failed authentication attempts with a subsequent successful login, enabling rapid identification of an active intrusion.

The alert is **high-fidelity**, **actionable**, and warrants immediate response.

---

### 8. Recommended Response Actions

If observed in a live environment, the following actions are recommended:

1. Immediately isolate the affected host
2. Terminate active SSH sessions from the source IP
3. Reset credentials for the compromised account (`root`)
4. Review authentication logs for additional compromised accounts
5. Block the source IP at the firewall
6. Conduct post-compromise forensics to identify persistence or lateral movement

---

### 9. Lessons Learned / Detection Value

This detection demonstrates the importance of correlating **failed authentication patterns with eventual success**, rather than treating brute-force attempts as low-priority noise.

The rule significantly reduces time-to-detection for credential-based intrusions and mirrors real-world SOC detection engineering practices.

##  My Reason To What This Proves to Hiring Teams

That I’ve now demonstrated:

* Real SOC alert triage
* Timeline reconstruction
* Adversary behavior analysis
* MITRE ATT&CK fluency
* Incident-level reasoning
* Clear executive-grade documentation

This is **not junior-level work**.
